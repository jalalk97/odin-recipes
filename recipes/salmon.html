  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This buttery lemon-garlic salmon is easy to throw together with a few simple ingredients. For best results, use
    center-cut fillets that are about 1-inch thick. Eight minutes cook time will produce salmon that is medium-well. Add
    1 to 2 more minutes for well done, but take care not to overcook. Cook time may vary with different model air
    fryers.</p>
